# healthcare-anomaly-detection

I'd be glad to create a README.md for your `healthcare-anomaly-detection` GitHub repository:

**healthcare-anomaly-detection**

This repository contains the code for detecting anomalies in healthcare data, developed as part of an Infosys internship. The project is divided into four weekly stages, with each folder representing the work done in that week. 

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop an anomaly detection system to identify unusual patterns in healthcare datasets. This can be beneficial for early disease detection, flagging potential errors in data collection, and providing insights for further investigation by medical professionals.

**Project Structure**

```
healthcare-anomaly-detection/
├── week_1/
│   └── ... (Code and explanations for Week 1)
├── week_2/

├── week_4/
│   └── ... (Code and explanations for Week 4)
├── infosys_internship_certificate_of_completion.jpg  (Certificate of Completion)
└── README.md (This file)
```

**Weekly Folders**

Each folder (`week_1`, `week_2`, `week_3`, `week_4`) contains the code and documentation for the corresponding week's work. The specific contents may vary depending on your implementation, but could include:

- Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and anomaly detection algorithms.
- Documentation explaining the code, chosen techniques, and results.
- Data files used in that week.
- Images or visualizations.

**Internship Certificate**

The `infosys_internship_certificate_of_completion.pdf` file provides a copy of your Infosys internship completion certificate for reference.

**Getting Started**

To understand the project in detail, follow these steps:

1. Browse through each weekly folder.
2. Read the documentation and code comments to understand the functionalities.
3. If provided, run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to replicate the results (ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed).
